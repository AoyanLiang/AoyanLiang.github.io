👋 Hi there, I am Aoyan! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and and hold a Master's degree in Computer Sciencea at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). My journey in Materials Science began at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China, where I received my Bachelor's degree, followed by a Master's degree, also at USC.

🔍 My research interest is a thrilling blend of atomistic simulations and cutting-edge machine learning techniques. I'm particularly interested in the nanoscale dynamical behavior, synthesis processes, structural correlations, and properties of advanced materials, such as high entropy alloys and metallic glasses.

👨‍🎓 Currently, I'm part of [Prof. Paulo Branicio's research lab](https://branicio.usc.edu/) at USC, and a research collaborator at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/) under the guidance of Dr. Vasily Bulatov. 

😃 Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work. I'm always open to discussions and collaborations, so don't hesitate to comment or reach out if you have any questions or ideas to share!
