üëã Hi there, I am Aoyan! I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Materials Science and a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). My journey in Materials Science began at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China, where I received my Bachelor's degree, followed by a Master's degree, also at USC.

üîç My research interest is a thrilling blend of atomistic simulations and cutting-edge machine learning techniques. I'm particularly interested in the nanoscale dynamical behavior, synthesis processes, structural correlations, and properties of advanced materials, such as high entropy alloys and metallic glasses.

üë®‚Äçüéì Currently, I'm part of [Prof. Paulo Branicio's research lab](https://branicio.usc.edu/) at USC, where I am involved in several innovative projects, including: 

- **High Entropy Alloy Films Microstructure Formation:** This project involves a combination of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations (using LAMMPS) and high-throughput experiments. Our goal is to unravel the composition-structure-property relationships in high entropy alloy films, focusing on those prepared through Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).

- **Energy Landscapes for Disordered Materials:** Utilizing the Activation Relaxation Technique (ART), this study aims to explore the energy landscapes of metallic glasses, particularly focusing on how heat treatment influences activation processes.

- **Nanoparticle Transport in Nanoporous Media:** In this project, we employ Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations to understand the mechanisms and key factors influencing nanoparticle transport and retention within nanoporous structures.

- **Hot-press Sintering for Nanoceramics:** This research involves conducting MD simulations (using Fortran+MPI codes) to investigate how variables like temperature, pressure, and particle size affect the densification process and microstructural evolution of AlN nanoceramics.

Each project is a step towards advancing our understanding of materials science through innovative computational algorithms and methods.
