👋 Hi there, I am Aoyan! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and and hold a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/). My journey in Materials Science began at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China, where I received my Bachelor's degree, followed by a Master's degree, also at USC.

🔍 My research interest is a thrilling blend of computational materials science and cutting-edge machine learning techniques. I'm particularly interested in using AI-driven techniques and atomistic simulations (including both density functional theory and molecular dynamics) to explore and design advanced materials, with a focus on accelerating materials discovery and optimizing processing for innovative applications.

👨‍🎓 Currently, I'm part of [Prof. Paulo Branicio's research lab](https://branicio.usc.edu/) at USC, and a research collaborator at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/) under the guidance of [Dr. Vasily Bulatov](https://people.llnl.gov/bulatov1). 

😃 Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work. I'm always open to discussions and collaborations, so don't hesitate to comment or reach out if you have any questions or ideas to share!
