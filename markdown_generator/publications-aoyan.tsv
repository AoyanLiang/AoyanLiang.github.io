2018-01-12	Recent developments concerning the dispersion methods and mechanisms of graphene	Coatings	"Abstract: Graphene, as a reinforcement for composite materials, has become a focus recently. However, the dispersion of graphene in composite materials is a problem that has been difficult to solve for a long time, which makes it difficult to produce and use graphene-reinforced composites on a large scale. Herein, methods to improve the dispersion of graphene and dispersion mechanisms that have been developed in recent years are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are compared and analyzed. On this basis, the dispersion methods and mechanisms of graphene are prospected, which lays the foundation for graphene application and preparation."

2021-09-27	Hot-press sintering of aluminum nitride nanoceramics	Physical Review Materials	"Abstract: The increasing interest in nanostructured ceramics and their applications highlights the need to understand the hot-press sintering of nanoscale AlN powders. We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hot-press sintering of AlN nanoceramics and to clarify the underlying sintering mechanisms. We consider samples with 32 nanoparticles with diameters 8, 12, and 16 nm, arranged in a face centered cubic supercell: samples AlN-8, AlN-12, and AlN-16. Sintering simulations are performed at T = 1900 K under 1 GPa for 6 ns. An additional simulation is performed for a sample with 8 nm sized nanoparticles at a lower pressure of 0.1 GPa, namely, sample AlN-8-0.1. After 6 ns, densifications of 99%, 96.2%, 95.6%, and 93.2% are achieved for samples AlN-8, AlN-8-0.1, AlN-12, and AlN-16, respectively. Analysis shows that the fast densification process is rooted at the high diffusivity of nanoparticles surface atoms. The AlN-8 sample undergoes intense microstructural evolution during the sintering process from 3 to 6 ns, resulting in a wide distribution of grain sizes from 4 to 15 nm and a larger, 11 nm average grain size. A slower grain growth process is observed in the AlN-8-0.1 sample from _4.0 ns. These results indicate a change in the densification mechanism from surface diffusion to grain boundary migration and relaxation of grain boundaries and triple junctions, resulting in a two-stage sintering process, i.e., initially the sample experiences a fast densification, which is followed by intense microstructural evolution. The densification mechanism crossover occurs at 98.7% and 95% densification for the AlN-8 and AlN-8-0.1 samples, respectively. The results indicate that the onset of the second stage depends on a densification threshold, which can be delayed by applying higher external pressure. Sintering of the AlN-16 sample indicates the presence of structural phase transformation at the nanoparticles contact points, which reach over 12 GPa of local pressure during the 1 GPa compression. These results provide atomistic insights into the hot-press sintering of nanoscale ceramics, highlighting the intrinsic swift densification and microstructural evolution processes."

2022-02-15	High pressure shear induced microstructural evolution in nanocrystalline aluminum	Computational Materials Science	"Abstract: The microstructural evolution of 4.5 nm grain-sized nanocrystalline aluminum under high pressure shear loading is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. A compression of 15 GPa is applied to the system concurrently with a shear deformation rate of 3.21 * 10^9 s^-1. Results show that the microstructural evolution is marked by a transient grain refinement regime followed by a steady grain growth process within 1 ns, coarsening the microstructure from 4.5 nm to 5.8 nm average grain size. The grain growth process is mediated by three independent deformation mechanisms: i) grain rotation; ii) grain boundary sliding; iii) and grain boundary migration. While the first two mechanisms are inherent grain boundary deformation mechanisms, the latter is driven by intense dislocation activity. Data indicates that during the deformation the dislocation density surges from 5 to 15 * 10^11 cm^-2, highlighting the important role of dislocation dynamics in the evolution of the microstructure. These atomistic insights shed light on the underlying complex incipient deformation processes, which are activated during severe plastic deformation of nanocrystalline materials."

2023-09-01	Uncovering metallic glasses hidden vacancy-like motifs using machine learning	Materials & Design	"Abstract: Vacancies are a ubiquitous type of defect in crystalline materials that can affect their properties and behavior, including atomic diffusivity, deformation processes, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. While well-defined in crystals, it is challenging to identify such topological footprints in the amorphous structure of metallic glasses (MGs). Here, we uncover an unforeseen vacancy-like structural motif named Q7, which refers to an atomic Voronoi polyhedron with seven quadrangular faces, by investigating MG local atomic configurations with the help of machine learning. The Q7 motif exhibits characteristics similar to crystalline vacancies and plays a significant role in short-range structural disorder in MGs. The atoms at the center of the Q7 motif display larger local entropy, atomic volume, and local tension. Additionally, its concentration follows an Arrhenius-like relationship with temperature, accurately indicating the glass transition temperature, and is strongly correlated with the yield and failure of MGs during mechanical deformation. The discovery of the Q7 motif provides new insights into understanding the intricate relationship between local disorder and structural relaxation in MGs, offering a remarkable ability to predict their thermal and mechanical behavior. This potentially paves the way for enhancements in the design and manufacturing processes of MGs and other amorphous materials. "	"Yuan, S., Liang, A., Liu, C., Nakano, A., Nomura, K., & Branicio, P.

2023-09-15	CoFeNiTix and CrFeNiTix high entropy alloy thin films microstructure formation	Acta Materialia	"Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEA) composition-structure relationships are crucial for guiding their design and applications. Here, we use a combined experimental and molecular dynamics (MD) approach to investigate phase formation during physical vapor deposition (PVD) of CoFeNiTix and CrFeNiTix HEA thin films. We vary titanium molar ratio from 0 to 1 to understand the role of a larger element in the alloy mixture. The experiments show that a high titanium content favors amorphous phase formation in the samples produced by magnetron co-sputtering. In contrast, a low titanium content results in the formation of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure in both HEA families. This effect of titanium content on the stability of the amorphous and FCC phases is reproduced in PVD MD simulations. The threshold titanium molar ratio is identified to be _0.53 and _0.16 for the CoFeNiTix and CrFeNiTix films in the experiments, and _0.53 and _0.53 in the MD simulations. In addition, the atomistic modeling allows for energy versus volume calculations with increasing titanium content, which demonstrate the stabilization of the amorphous phase with respect to crystalline structures. To isolate the effect of atomic sizes, additional simulations are performed using an average-atom model, which disregards differences in atomic radii while preserving the average properties of the alloy. In these simulations, the energetic stability of the amorphous phase disappears. The combined experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the formation of the amorphous phase in HEA thin films generated by PVD is directly caused by the atomic size difference.

2023-12-18	Effect of heat treatment paths on the aging and rejuvenation of metallic glasses	Physical Review Materials	"Abstract: This study explores the influence of heat treatment paths on the structural relaxation of metallic glasses (MGs) in the regime of fast dynamics. We create MG samples using various quenching rates, from 10^9 to 10^11 K/s, and expose these samples to near-Tg heat treatments with assorted combinations of heating (cooling) rates, from 5 * 10^10 to 5 * 10^12 K/s, and annealing durations, from 10 ps to 10 ns. Results show that the effect of the heating rate is intricately tied to the initial structure of the MG, while a decrease in the cooling rate invariably intensifies the aging process. Extending the annealing duration may induce either aging or rejuvenation, subject to the specific thermal history. To interpret these findings, we hypothesize that the memory effect, governed by the activation and annihilation of reversible and irreversible flow units, underpins the rejuvenation-aging competition in MGs. Moreover, we suggest viewing the cooling stage as an annealing phase controlled by gradient temperature and fine-tuning its rate to achieve the targeted active-flow unit distributions. This study illuminates the role of fast dynamics during the glass relaxation process and offers practical strategies for tailoring heat treatments to optimize MG structures and mechanical performance."
