<b>Abstract</b>: Colloid transport and retention in porous media are critical processes influencing various Earth science applications, from groundwater remediation to enhanced oil recovery. These phenomena become particularly complex in the confined spaces of nanoporous media, where strong boundary layer effects and nanoconfinement significantly alter colloid behavior. In this work, we use particle dynamics models to simulate colloid transport and retention processes in bicontinuous nanoporous (BNP) media under pressure gradients. By utilizing particle-based models, we track the movement of each colloid and elucidate the underlying colloid retention mechanisms. Under unfavorable attachment conditions, the results reveal two colloid retention mechanisms: physical straining and trapping in low-flow zone. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of critical factors including colloid volume fraction, $d$, pressure difference, $\Delta P$, interaction between colloids and BNP media, $E_{c-p}$, and among colloids, $E_{c-c}$, on colloid transport. Analysis of breakthrough curves and colloid displacements demonstrates that higher values of $d$, lower values of $\Delta P$, and strong $E_{c-p}$ attractions significantly increase colloid retention, which further lead to colloid clogging and jamming. In contrast, $E_{c-c}$ has minimal impact on colloid transport due to the limited colloidâ€“colloid interaction in nanoporous channels. This work provides critical insights into the fundamental factors governing colloid transport and retention within stochastic nanoporous materials.
