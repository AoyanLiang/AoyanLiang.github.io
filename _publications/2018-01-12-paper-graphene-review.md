excerpt: 'Abstract: Graphene, as a reinforcement for composite materials, has become a focus recently. However, the dispersion of graphene in composite materials is a problem that has been difficult to solve for a long time, which makes it difficult to produce and use graphene-reinforced composites on a large scale. Herein, methods to improve the dispersion of graphene and dispersion mechanisms that have been developed in recent years are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are compared and analyzed. On this basis, the dispersion methods and mechanisms of graphene are prospected, which lays the foundation for graphene application and preparation.'

Abstract: Graphene, as a reinforcement for composite materials, has become a focus recently. However, the dispersion of graphene in composite materials is a problem that has been difficult to solve for a long time, which makes it difficult to produce and use graphene-reinforced composites on a large scale. Herein, methods to improve the dispersion of graphene and dispersion mechanisms that have been developed in recent years are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are compared and analyzed. On this basis, the dispersion methods and mechanisms of graphene are prospected, which lays the foundation for graphene application and preparation.
