<b>Course Summary:</b>
This course is intended for graduate students in Materials Science and Engineering. The course aims to introduce students to a broad treatment of classical and statistical thermodynamics and its applications to equilibrium properties of materials. The course will provide a thermodynamic framework for treating general phenomena in materials science, e.g., chemical reactions, diffusion, and point defects. A focus of the course will be maps of equilibrium states such as phase diagrams. Course topics include the laws of thermodynamics, statistical thermodynamics, solutions, phase equilibria, phase transformations, and phase diagrams of binary and ternary alloys.
