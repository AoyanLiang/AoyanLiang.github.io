<b>Course Summary:</b>
This course reviews the production processes of confectionery products, starting with simple sweets such as hard candies and sugar shell, through jelly, marshmallow, nougat, and toffee, to the more complex systems of caramel, fudge, and chocolate. While learning about the equipment and technology, we cover the chemical and physical mechanisms that give our candies their taste, texture, and appearance. This includes solubility, nucleation, crystals growth, the amorphous state, phase transitions, heat and mass transfer, vapor pressure, emulsions and foams stability, browning, gelation, polymorphism, and more. We will also describe how process and product development is done in R&D through the stage-gate framework, and how data science tools accelerate development and increase reliability
