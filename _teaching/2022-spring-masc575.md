<b>Course Summary:</b>
This course introduces basics of atomistic simulation methods with special focuses on Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Due to the rapid advances of high-performance parallel computers, atomistic simulation has become an essential tool to investigate material structures and properties. The course provides overview of atomistic simulations, their applications, underlying theory and algorithms. Hands-on projects using the USC Advanced  Research Computing supercomputer develops solid understanding of how to design and perform materials simulations. This course is designed for graduate students with any science and engineering background. No prior experience of programming is necessary.
