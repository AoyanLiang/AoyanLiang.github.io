Utilizing Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations, this study provides a detailed analysis of the colloid transport and retention processes within nanoporous media. The visualizations below, expertly crafted using OVITO, illuminate the intricate interplay between colloids and the nanoporous structure.

The videos illustrate the two retention mechanisms observed under conditions where there is negligible attraction between colloids and the nanoporous media. The retained colloids and their trajectories are highlighted in red for clarity. The first video captures a colloid retained by physical straining, where it becomes lodged in a narrow pore throat. The second video showcases a colloid trapped in a low-flow zone, a region characterized by minimal or even stagnant flow due to the stochastic nature of the nanoporous structure.

We also conducted a comprehensive parametric study to explore different environmental factors—such as pressure, colloid density, and solution chemistry—that influence colloid transport behavior. This research aims to enhance the control of such processes in fine-grained geological systems like tight shale formations.
