In this comparative study, we delve into the fascinating process of hot-press sintering for aluminum nitride (AlN) nanoceramics. By examining two distinct particle sizes, we uncover the subtle yet crucial differences in microstructural evolution. Witness these changes firsthand through our simulation videos:

On the left, observe the sintering dynamics of smaller AlN particles with a diameter of 8 nm. Contrast this with the sintering behavior of larger AlN particles, 16 nm in diameter, shown on the right. These visualizations not only provide insights into the sintering process at the nanoscale but also highlight the influence of particle size on the densification and microstructural properties of the ceramics.
